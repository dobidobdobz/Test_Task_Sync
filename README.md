# Test_Task_Sync

Syncs two folders,  program runs a loop and copies the contents of the source folder to to replica. 
and logs the event in a text file. I have filled the source folder with random content to be synced!

I was also considering writing code that would only sync the folders if it detects source file's have been 
modifed. But I wasnt sure if this is necessery!
